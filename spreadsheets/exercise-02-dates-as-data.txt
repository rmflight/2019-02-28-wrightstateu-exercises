Challenge: pulling month, day and year out of dates

* In the dates tab of your spreadsheet you have the data from 2014 plot 3. There’s a `Date collected` column.
* Let’s extract month, day and year from the dates to new columns. For this we can use the built in Excel functions

YEAR() MONTH() 
DAY()

(Make sure the new column is formatted as a number and not as a date.)

You can see that even though you wanted the year to be 2014, your spreadsheet program automatically interpreted it as 2015, the year you entered the data.
