Challenge: pulling hour, minute and second out of the current time

Current time and date are best retrieved using the functions NOW(), which returns the current date and time, and TODAY(), which returns the current date. The results will be formatted according to your computerâ€™s settings.

1) Extract the year, month and day from the current date and time string returned by the NOW() function.
2) Calculate the current time using NOW()-TODAY(). 
3) Extract the hour, minute and second from the current time using functions HOUR(), MINUTE() and SECOND().
4) Press F9 to force the spreadsheet to recalculate the NOW() function, and check that it has been updated.
