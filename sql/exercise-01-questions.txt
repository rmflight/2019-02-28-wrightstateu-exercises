1 - Download these files from https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459
  * surveys.csv
  * species.csv
  * plots.csv
2 - Open each of these csv files and explore them. What information is contained in each file? Specifically, if I had the following research questions:
  * How has the hindfoot length and weight of Dipodomys species changed over time?
  * What is the average weight of each species, per year?
  * What information can I learn about Dipodomys species in the 2000s, over time?
What would I need to answer these questions? Which files have the data I need? What operations would I need to perform if I were doing these analyses by hand?
