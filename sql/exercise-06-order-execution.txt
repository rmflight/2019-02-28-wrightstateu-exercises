* Let’s try to combine what we’ve learned so far in a single query. Using the surveys table write a query to display the three date fields, species_id, and weight in kilograms (rounded to two decimal places), for individuals captured in 1999, ordered alphabetically by the species_id.
* Write the query as a single line, then put each clause on its own line, and see how more legible the query becomes!

# SELECT year, month, day, species_id, ROUND(weight / 1000, 2)
# FROM surveys
# WHERE year = 1999
# ORDER BY species_id;
