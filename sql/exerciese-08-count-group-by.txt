Write queries that return:

1 - How many individuals were counted in each year in total
2 - How many were counted each year, for each different species
3 - The average weights of each species in each year

Can you get the answer to both 2 and 3 in a single query?

# SELECT year, COUNT(*)
# FROM surveys
# GROUP BY year;

# SELECT year, species_id, COUNT(*), AVG(weight) 
# FROM surveys
# GROUP BY year, species_id;
