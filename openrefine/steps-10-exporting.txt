1 - Click the Export button in the top right and select Export project.
2 - A tar.gz file will download to your default Download directory. The tar.gz extension tells you that this is a compressed file. Which means that this file contains multiple files. You can double-click on the tar.gz file and it will expand into a directory. A folder icon will now appear.
  * On Windows, opening tar.gz files requires additional software such as 7-zip or WinZip. Download and run the installer of your choice.
  * Double-click the exported tar.gz file. If Windows asks how you want to open the file, check the ‘Always use this app to open .gz files’ box, then select “More apps”.
  * If your chosen application is not listed, select ‘Look for another app on this PC’.
  * In the file browser, navigate to C:\Program Files, find the application you installed, and double-click on its executable (7zFM, for example).
3 - Look at the files that appear in this folder. What files are here? What information do you think these files contain?
