1 - Let us suppose we want to split the scientificName column into separate columns for genus and for species.
2 - Click the down arrow at the top of the scientificName column. Choose Edit Column > Split into several columns...
3 - In the pop-up, in the Separator box, replace the comma with a space.
4 - Uncheck the box that says Remove this column.
5 - Click OK. Youâ€™ll get some new columns called scientificName 1, scientificName 2, and so on.
6 - Notice that in some cases scientificName 1 and scientificName 2 are empty. Why is this? What do you think we can do to fix this?
