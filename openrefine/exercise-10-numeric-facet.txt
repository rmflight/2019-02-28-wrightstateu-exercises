1 - For a column you transformed to numbers, edit one or two cells, replacing the numbers with text (such as abc) or blank (no number or text).
2 - Use the pulldown menu to apply a numeric facet to the column you edited. The facet will appear in the left panel.
3 - Notice that there are several checkboxes in this facet: Numeric, Non-numeric, Blank, and Error. Below these are counts of the number of cells in each category. You should see checks for Non-numeric and Blank if you changed some values.
4 - Experiment with checking or unchecking these boxes to select subsets of your data.
